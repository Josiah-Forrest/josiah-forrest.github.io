       My business idea is a social media app that is strictly for musicians. It will help the musicians with their music and it will allow them to post their music on this website and get constructive advice about their music and about their struggles with their music. It’s a good place to vent and build a good support system. It is different from Instagram because Instagram is strictly for posting videos and clips and isn't specifically for musicians and artists. It isn't like BandLab because Bandlab is for posting and making music and collaborations but does give anyone a chance in the actual music industry and doesn't give an artist any real world experience. My app will let them get constructive criticism and help them get endorsements and opportunities and experience from the music industry. It’s like a miniature record label that will take the kids who don’t get to prove themselves in the music industry. My business plans to be the best service among all competition in this category
